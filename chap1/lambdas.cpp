    A lambda function is often referred to as an
    **anonymous function object**. A lambda function can
    be passed as an argument in another function.
    This last property is what makes them so powerful for use within
    standard algorithms, which again are covered in Chapter 5.

    /*
        (i) by default, a lambdaâ€™s return type is deduced following the same rules as those
        used for auto variables; that is, their return type is the type of the expression used for
        the return statement. However, we can specify it with:
    */

    { return (x + y) / 2.0; };

    /*
        (ii) Second, be sure to place a semicolon at the end of the lambda block.
        (iii) Third, in cases of no function arguments, such as in the first example, the parentheses
        are generally optional (except, technically speaking, for special cases we need not
        be concerned with in this book)

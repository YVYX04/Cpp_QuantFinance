# Learning Modern C++ for Finance 
## *Foundations for Quantitative Programming*

### Description
In this repository, you will find some selected `.cpp` programs that I implemented based on the book:
> Hanson, D. (2025). Learning Modern C++ for Finance: Foundations for Quantitative Programming. *O'Reilly*.

I am building and implementing some concepts of the book. You will find this repository useful if you are
looking for modern C++ features implementation (C++17, C++20 mainly) and best practices in the quantitative
finance field.

### Structure
If you are reading the book in parallel, you will observe that I structured my files based on the different
chapters covered. Here is a brief tabe of contents (materials already covered by me):

1. An Overview of C++
2. Writing User-Defined Classes with Modern C++ Features
